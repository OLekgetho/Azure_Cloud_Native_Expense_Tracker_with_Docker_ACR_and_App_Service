# Azure Cloud-Native Expense Tracker with Docker, ACR, and App Service

## Tools Used
- Containerization: Utilized Docker to package the application into portable containers.
- Azure Container Registry (ACR): Stored and managed Docker images securely in Azure.
- Azure App Service: Deployed the Dockerized application to a cloud-native hosting environment.
- Frontend Development: Created an interactive user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Backend Development: Developed server-side logic and APIs with Node.js.

## Description

In this project, I developed a cloud-native expense tracker application using Node.js for backend processing and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.
The application was containerized with Docker to ensure portability and scalability.

The Docker image was pushed to Azure Container Registry (ACR) for centralized image management, and the app was deployed to Azure App Service for reliable cloud hosting. 
This project demonstrates my ability to design, build, and deploy modern applications using containerization and Azure cloud technologies.

## Deployment Workflow
Containerization with Docker
- Wrote a Dockerfile to build the container image of the Node.js application.
- Built and tagged the image locally.

Push to Azure Container Registry (ACR)
- Configured an Azure Container Registry for image storage.
- Logged in to the ACR and pushed the Docker image using docker push.

Deploy to Azure App Service
- Created an Azure App Service plan.
- Configured the service to pull the Docker image from ACR.
- Set up environment variables and ensured seamless integration
